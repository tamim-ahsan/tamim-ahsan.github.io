I am a **PhD Candidate** at the School of Science, **University of Wollongong**, New South Wales, Australia. Currently, I am also affiliated with the **University of Sydney** (Australia), the **Max Planck Institue of Psychiatry** (Germany) and the **National Institute of Biotechnology** (Bangladesh). 

My PhD project adopts a **spatially resolved single-nucleus multimodal** approach to delineate **stress-induced molecular changes** in the **brains** of **psychiatric patients**.

In future, I aspire to continue leveraging **single-cell** and **spatial omics** technologies to decipher the molecular underpinnings of complex biological processes.
